# Changelog

## v0.3.0 (March 24, 2025)

- Updated the base image of the Dockerfile to the latest version of PyTorch (from PyTorch 2.5.1, CUDA 12.4 and cuDNN 9 to PyTorch 2.6.0 CUDA 12.4 and cuDNN 9).
- Updated the ComfyUI version to the latest version (from ComfyUI 0.3.7 to ComfyUI 0.3.27).
- Updated the ComfyUI Manager version to the latest version (from ComfyUI Manager 2.55.5 to ComfyUI Manager 3.31.8).
- Installed the packages `libgl1-mesa-glx` and `libglib2.0-0`, which will hopefully fix issues with the ComfyUI Impact Pack, ComfyUI Impact Subpack, and ComfyUI Inspire Pack custom nodes that were missing the `libGL.so.1` and `libgthread-2.0.so.0` libraries.
- The APT cache is now being cleaned after installing the packages to reduce the image size.

## v0.2.0 (December 16, 2024)

- Previously, only the model files were stored outside of the container, but the custom nodes installed by ComfyUI Manager were not. The reason was that the ComfyUI Manager itself is implemented as a custom node, which means that mounting a host system directory into the custom nodes directory would hide the ComfyUI Manager. This problem was fixed by installing the ComfyUI Manager in a separate directory and symlinking it upon container startup into the mounted directory.
- It is now possible to specify the user ID and group ID of the host system user as environment variables when starting the container. During startup, the container will create a user with the same user ID and group ID, and run ComfyUI with this user. This is helpful, because the model and custom node files downloaded by the ComfyUI Manager will be owned by the host system user instead of `root`. The documentation in the read me was updated to reflect this change.
- Updated the image to the latest version of ComfyUI (from v0.3.4 to v0.3.7).
- In the previous version, the main branch of the ComfyUI Manager was installed and not a specific version. Since the main branch may contain breaking changes or bugs, the ComfyUI Manager is now installed with a specific version (v2.55.5).
- The ComfyUI Manager installs its dependencies when it is first launched. This means that the dependencies have to be installed every time the container is started. To avoid this, the dependencies are now installed manually during the image build process.
- While the custom nodes themselves are installed outside of the container, their requirements are installed inside of the container. This means that stopping and removing the container will remove the installed requirements. Therefore, the dependencies are now installed when the container is started again.
- The directory structure of the ComfyUI models directory is now automatically created upon container startup if it does not exist.
- The Docker image now has two more tags: one with the ComfyUI version and the second with the ComfyUI and ComfyUI Manager versions that are installed in the image. This makes it easier for users to find out which ComfyUI version they are installing before pulling the image.
- A section was added to the read me, which explains how to update the local image to the latest version.

## v0.1.0 (November 28, 2024)

- Created a Docker image for running ComfyUI.
- The image includes ComfyUI and ComfyUI Manager.
- The image is based on the latest version of the PyTorch image.
- A GitHub Actions workflow is used to automatically build and publish the Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry when a release is created.
